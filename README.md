## To-Do List API

A simple RESTful API for managing tasks in a to-do list application. This API allows users to perform basic operations such as creating, updating, viewing, and deleting tasks. It also includes features for managing task statuses, filtering tasks by completion status, due dates, and priorities. The API is lightweight and does not require authentication, making it easy to integrate into any task management app.

### Core Features:
- **Task Management**:
  - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
  - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task with a title, description, and due date.
  - `GET /tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Update task details, such as marking it as completed or changing its due date.
  - `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Delete a task from the list.
  
- **Task Status**:
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}/complete`: Mark a task as completed.
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}/incomplete`: Mark a task as incomplete.

- **Filtering Tasks**:
  - `GET /tasks?completed=true`: Retrieve all completed tasks.
  - `GET /tasks?completed=false`: Retrieve all incomplete tasks.
  - `GET /tasks?due_date={YYYY-MM-DD}`: Get tasks due on a specific date.

- **Task Priorities**:
  - `GET /tasks?priority={priority_level}`: Filter tasks by priority (e.g., low, medium, high).
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}/priority`: Update the priority level of a task.

### Sample Use Cases:
- **Simple Task Management Apps**: Allows users to manage personal to-do lists with basic functionalities like task creation, updates, and deletion.
- **Project Management**: Helps track project tasks, deadlines, and completion status by filtering tasks based on due dates or progress.
- **Personal Organization**: A lightweight tool for managing everyday tasks like shopping lists, reminders, and personal goals.

This API is designed to be straightforward and easy to use for anyone who needs a basic to-do list functionality.
